 Call this method to remove ads from the view
 
 If `permanent` is set to YES, ads will not show until the app is next launched, or until the restartAds method is called.
 
 When set to NO, ads will only be removed off-screen temporarily - typically just a few minutes until the delegate receives a new ad.
 You probably won't have a use for this in production, but may find it useful when testing.

 If `permanent` AND `remember` are both set to YES, a boolean will be set in NSUserDefaults to remember this across future app launches.
 A typical use of this might be if your user purchases an IAP to remove ads from the app.

 Call this method to restart ad serving.
 
 This is intended to be called after removeAdsAndMakePermanent:YES has been called.
 It WILL take into account the andRemember boolean though, so ad serving will not be restarted

/*
 Before using any of the following properties or methods, please read this page: https://firebase.google.com/docs/admob/ios/targeting
 AdMob allows you to target the ads shown to your users, based on their gender, age and/or location.
 Google stresses that you should only use this demographic data if your app already makes use of it.
 i.e. don't collect this data from your user's solely for the pupose of showing targeted ads to them.
 
 GADRequest.h is also commented with notes on using this kind of data
 
 If you do not wish to show targeted ads to your users, you can just ignore all this and don't set any of these values in your app delegate.
